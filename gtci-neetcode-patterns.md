## 1. Arrays and hashing

### Pattern - use a set to collect uniques/best-so-far
### Pattern - use a hashmap to store index/value pairs
### Pattern - pre-calculate and adjust components as you go


## 2. Two Pointers

Use for problems involving arrays or linked lists where you need to find pairs that meet certain criteria.

```python
def two_pointers(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return [-1, -1]
```

## 21. Tree BFS

Use for problems involving level order traversal of a binary tree.

```python
from collections import deque

def level_order_traversal(root):
    result, queue = [], deque([root])
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        current_level = []
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            current_level.append(node.value)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        result.append(current_level)
    return result
```

## 22. Trie

Use for problems that involve prefix trees or tries to solve problems related to strings.

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word

    def starts_with(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True
```

Use for problems involving the merging of sets and checking whether elements are in the same set

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = {}

    def find(self, x):
        y = self.id.get(x, x)
        if y != x:
            self.id[x] = y = self.find(y)
        return y

    def union(self, x, y):
        self.id[self.find(x)] = self.find(y)
